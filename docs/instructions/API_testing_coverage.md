In the file #file:OpenWeather.md I have defined the OpenWeather API schema. This is being tested in my tests in the folder #file:test . Check if the tests for my implemented features are being covered by the tests. Pay attention to edge cases and testing differente matrices of output.

Do not fix anything, but create me a test_coverage_report.md file in teh root folder. It should report what is missing, where it's missing and what are the remediating actions.
