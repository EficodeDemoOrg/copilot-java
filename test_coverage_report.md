# Weather Application Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the test coverage of the Simple Weather CLI application, specifically focusing on the OpenWeather API schema-related functionality. The report identifies gaps in test coverage and provides recommendations for improving test quality and coverage.

## Current Test Coverage Status

### Well-Covered Areas

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - ✅ Fetching weather data for valid cities
   - ✅ Error handling for invalid city names
   - ✅ Validation of API key requirements
   - ✅ Network error handling
   - ✅ Invalid JSON response handling

2. **Security**
   - ✅ City name validation against potential injection attacks
   - ✅ API key validation

### Areas with Inadequate Coverage

1. **OpenWeather API Response Fields**
   - ❌ **Missing coverage for specific fields in the API response**:
     - Only basic fields are tested (city name, temperature, and weather description)
     - No tests for other fields like humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.

2. **Edge Cases**
   - ❌ **Missing tests for unusual but valid values**:
     - Extreme temperatures (very high or low)
     - Special characters in city names (e.g., accented characters)

3. **Response Parsing**
   - ❌ **Incomplete validation of JSON parsing logic**:
     - Only happy path is tested for valid JSON structure
     - Missing tests for partial JSON responses
     - Missing tests for absent optional fields

4. **Error Scenarios**
   - ❌ **Incomplete coverage for all HTTP status codes**:
     - 404 (Not Found) is tested, but others like 429 (Rate Limit) are not explicitly tested
     - Missing tests for malformed but syntactically valid JSON

5. **Units Conversion**
   - ❌ **No tests validating correct temperature unit handling**:
     - No verification that the API returns data in the expected units (metric)

## Detailed Missing Test Cases

### 1. Weather Fields Coverage

The OpenWeather API provides a rich set of data fields, but tests only verify three basic fields:
- `name` (city name)
- `main.temp` (temperature)
- `weather[0].description` (weather description)

**Missing Tests:**
- Tests for `main` object fields: `feels_like`, `pressure`, `humidity`, `temp_min`, `temp_max`
- Tests for `wind` object fields: `speed`, `deg`, `gust`
- Tests for `clouds.all` (cloudiness percentage)
- Tests for `rain` and `snow` precipitation data
- Tests for `sys` object fields especially `country`, `sunrise`, and `sunset`
- Tests for `timezone` and coordinate data

### 2. Edge Case Handling

**Missing Tests:**
- City names with accented characters (e.g., "Zürich", "São Paulo")
- City names with apostrophes (e.g., "N'Djamena")
- Very long city names
- Extreme weather values (e.g., temperatures above 50°C or below -50°C)
- Boundary cases for all numeric fields
- Handling of empty arrays or null fields in the response

### 3. HTTP Error Handling

The current test suite covers 404 (Not Found) errors, but has inadequate coverage for other error codes:

**Missing Tests:**
- 401 (Unauthorized) - Invalid API key
- 429 (Too Many Requests) - Rate limiting
- 500 (Internal Server Error) - Server-side issues
- 503 (Service Unavailable) - Temporary unavailability

### 4. Parsing Robustness

**Missing Tests:**
- Handling of missing non-required fields in the response
- Handling of null values for expected fields
- Handling of different units (imperial vs. metric)
- Validation of correct timezone handling

## Recommendations

### 1. Enhance WeatherData Class and Tests

**Action:** Extend the `WeatherData` class to include more fields from the OpenWeather API response.

```java
// Add fields to WeatherData.java:
private final double feelsLike;
private final int humidity;
private final double windSpeed;
private final int windDeg;
private final String country;
// etc.
```

**Corresponding tests needed for:**
- Getters for all new fields
- Constructor validation
- toString() representation

### 2. Improve OpenWeatherMapClient Tests

**Action:** Add more comprehensive test cases for the `parseJsonResponse` method:

- Test parsing of full JSON response with all possible fields
- Test handling of missing optional fields
- Test extreme values (boundary testing)

### 3. Add Error Handling Tests

**Action:** Create explicit tests for each possible error code:

- Test 401 Unauthorized responses
- Test 429 Rate Limit responses
- Test handling of server errors (500, 503)

### 4. Add Unit Conversion Tests

**Action:** Add tests that verify the correct handling of unit conversions:

- Test that imperial units are correctly converted to metric if needed
- Verify temperature conversion logic if implemented

### 5. Add Integration Tests

**Action:** Create integration tests that use real API responses (or realistic mocks):

- Test against complete, real-world JSON responses
- Test handling of different weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.)

## Priority Actions

1. **High Priority:** Enhance `WeatherData` class to include more fields from the API response
2. **High Priority:** Add tests for HTTP error codes (401, 429)
3. **Medium Priority:** Add edge case tests for extreme values and special characters
4. **Medium Priority:** Implement tests for handling missing or null fields
5. **Low Priority:** Add tests for unit conversions

## Conclusion

While the current test suite provides good coverage of basic functionality and error handling, there are significant gaps in testing the full range of data returned by the OpenWeather API. Implementing the recommended tests will significantly improve the application's robustness and reliability.
